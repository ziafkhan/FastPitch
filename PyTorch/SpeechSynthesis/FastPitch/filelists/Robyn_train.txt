wavs/robyn_robyn_0002.wav|Dragon look in his cupboard. But there was no food at all.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0004.wav|Dragon got into his car and drove.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0005.wav|The food store was at the top of a hill.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0006.wav|It was a very steep drive
wavs/robyn_robyn_0007.wav|Dragon loved to go shopping. He was a very wise shopper.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0008.wav|He bought food only from the five basic groups.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0009.wav|He bought cheese curls from the dairy group, he bought doughnuts from the bread group.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0010.wav|He bought cat catshup from the fruit grou and vegetable group,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0011.wav|He b
wavs/robyn_robyn_0013.wav|fu fudge
wavs/robyn_robyn_0014.wav|and he bought fudge pudge from the chocolate group.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0015.wav|Dragon had a balanced diet
wavs/robyn_robyn_0016.wav|He had so much food that he could not fit it all into his car
wavs/robyn_robyn_0017.wav|I know what I will do said dragon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0018.wav|I will eat some of the food now and the rest will fit in the car.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0019.wav|Dragon sat in the parking lot
wavs/robyn_robyn_0021.wav|Dragon sat in the parking lot and started to eat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0022.wav|He crunched up the cheese curls, he donated the doughnuts, he packed away the pork riiinds.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0023.wav|Dragon ate and ate and ate until all the food was gone.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0024.wav|burp
wavs/robyn_robyn_0025.wav|Now dragon could not fit into his car.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0026.wav|Oh what am I going to do
wavs/robyn_robyn_0027.wav|cried dragon
wavs/robyn_robyn_0028.wav|I know what I will do, said dragon, I will push my car home
wavs/robyn_robyn_0029.wav|So dragon pushed his car down the hill.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0030.wav|So dragon pushed his car down the hill.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0031.wav|The car began to roll. Faster and faster and faster and faster.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0033.wav|Right in front of his house.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0034.wav|All the excitement had made dragon very hungry.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0035.wav|He went into his kitchen
wavs/robyn_robyn_0036.wav|and looked in the cupboard.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0037.wav|There was no food at all. The cupboard is bare, said dragon. Time to go shopping.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0038.wav|The End.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0039.wav|Big bear lake. In August, Henry and Henry's big dog, Mudge, always went camping. They went with Henry's parents.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0041.wav|Henry's dad didn't know anything about camping. He just came with a guitar and sm smiles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0042.wav|Henry and Mudge loved camping. This year they were going to big bear lake and Henry's cou Henry couldn't wait.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0043.wav|We might even see a bear, Henry said. Henry was not sh so sure he wanted to see a bear.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0044.wav|He shivered and but put an arm around Mudge.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0045.wav|Mudge have a gave a big slow loud yaun yaun. He drooled on henry's foot.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0046.wav|Henry giggled, no bears will get us, Mudge, Henry said. We're not too slippery. We're too slippery.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0047.wav|Mudge gave a big slow loud yawn. He drooled on henry's foot. Henry giggled, no bear will get us, Mudge, Henry said. We too slippery.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0048.wav|A good smelly hike. Henry and Mudge and Henry's parents drove to big bear lake
wavs/robyn_robyn_0050.wav|Everyone had a backpack, even mudge. His had lot his had lots of crackers.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0051.wav|Henry's mother said, let's go and off they went. They walked and walked and climbed and...
wavs/robyn_robyn_0052.wav|They walked and walked and climbed and climbed.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0053.wav|It was a beautiful. It was beautiful. Henry saw a fish jump straight aat out of a stream. He saw a doe and her f her fawn.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0054.wav|He saw waterfalls and rainbow
wavs/robyn_robyn_0055.wav|Mudge didn't see much of anything.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0056.wav|Mudge loved to hike and smell.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0057.wav|He smelled a racoon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0058.wav|He smelled a racoon from yesterday, he smelled a deer from the last night, he smelled an oatmeal cookie from henry's back pocket.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0059.wav|Mudge, Henry laughed off, giving Mudge the cookie.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0060.wav|Finally, Henry's mother picked a good place to camp.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0061.wav|Henry's parents set up the tent. Henry's unpacked Henry unpacked the food and pants and lanterns. Mudge unpacked a ham sandwich.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0062.wav|Finally, the camp was almost ready. It needed just one more thing.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0063.wav|Who knows the words to love me tender said henry's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0064.wav|Henry looked at Mudge and groaned.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0065.wav|It was a beautiful night. Henry and Henry's parents lay on her back.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0067.wav|There's the big dipper, said Henry's mother, there's the little dipper, said Henry.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0068.wav|Mudge wasn't looking.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0069.wav|Mudge loved camping.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0070.wav|Henry's father sang one more sappy love song.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0072.wav|It was as quiet as quiet could be.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0073.wav|Everyone slept safe and sound and there were no bears no scares.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0074.wav|Just the clean smell of trees and wonderful green dreams. The end.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0075.wav|Julius, story by angela johnson
wavs/robyn_robyn_0076.wav|alabama but wintered in alaska. He told Maya that was the reason he liked ice cubes in his coffee.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0077.wav|On one of granddaddy's visits from alaska he brought a crate.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0078.wav|Granddaddy smiled. Something for my special you.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0079.wav|Maya hoped it was a horse or an older brother. She'd always wanted one or the other.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0081.wav|But it was a pig. A big pig. An alaskan pig who did a polar bear imitation
wavs/robyn_robyn_0082.wav|and climbed out of the crate. Julius had come.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0083.wav|Maya's parents didn't think that they would like Julius. He showed them no fun no sharing. Maya loved Julius.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0084.wav|Though, so he stayed.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0085.wav|There never was enough food in the house after Julius came to stay. He slurped coffee and ate too much peanut butter.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0086.wav|Julius made big mess.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0087.wav|He would he would roll himself in flour when he wanted Maya to bake him cookies.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0088.wav|Julius made a big messes and spread the newspaper everywhere before anyone could read it. He left crumbs on the sheet and never picked up hids towels.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0089.wav|Julius made too much noise. He'd stay up late watching old movies and he'd always play records when everybody else wanted to read.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0090.wav|But Maya knew the other Julius too the Julius who was fun to take on walks...
wavs/robyn_robyn_0091.wav|But Maya knew the other Julius too the Julius who was fun to take on walks cause he did great dog imitation and chase cats.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0092.wav|He the Julius who sneaked into stores with her and and tried on clothis. Julius like anything blue and stretchy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0093.wav|They try on hats to make like red felt, Julius liked straw, it tasted better.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0094.wav|Trying on shoes was hard.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0095.wav|They'd try on hats too. Maya liked red felt. Julius liked straw. It tasted better. Trying on shoes was hard, though.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0096.wav|Julius would swing for hours on the playground with Maya.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0097.wav|He'd protect her from the scary things at night too, sometimes
wavs/robyn_robyn_0098.wav|Maya loved the Julius.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0099.wav|...and eat peanut butter from the jar without getting any on the ceiling.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0100.wav|Maya didn't think all the other brothers in the world could have taught her that.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0101.wav|Julius loved the Maya who thought him that even thought he was a pig he didn't have to act like a he lived in a barn.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0102.wav|Julius loved the Maya who thought him that even though he was a pig he didn't have to act like he lived in a barn
wavs/robyn_robyn_0104.wav|Maya shared the things she learned from Julius
wavs/robyn_robyn_0105.wav|Maya shared the things sh she learned from Julius with her friends.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0108.wav|Julius shared the things Maya had thought him with her parents sometimes.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0109.wav|And that was all right because living with Maya and sharing everything was even better than being an cool pig from alaska.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0111.wav|The Surprise. Written by Janson Marshall. One late summer morning greg had a wicket idea. I should he said. I really should. Shouldn't.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0112.wav|I shouldn't he said, I really shouldn't but he just could help, couldn't help himself. Here comes the rain he cried.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0113.wav|Agots screamed Martha.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0114.wav|Martha was thoroughly denched and as mad as a wet hen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0117.wav|But Martha was unmooed.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0119.wav|Then she remembered,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0121.wav|I was only horsing around said Gre George. But Martha was unmoved.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0122.wav|The next morning Martha reed a funny story. I can't wait to tell George, she said. Then she remembered that she and George were no longer on speaking terms. Around noon Martha heard a joke on the radio.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0123.wav|George will love this one, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0124.wav|But she and George weren't speaking. In the afternoon Martha observed the first autumn leave fall to the ground. Autumn is George's favorite season, she said. Another leave came swirling down. That does it, said Martha. Martha went straight to George house. George's house. I forgive you, she said. George was the likely to be back on speaking terms. Good friends just can't stay cross for long, said George.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0125.wav|Good friends can't stay cross for long said George.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0126.wav|You can say that again, said Martha and together they watched the autumn arrive.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0129.wav|Mr. Brown went to town. By Wong Herbert Lee
wavs/robyn_robyn_0130.wav|Mr. Brown was in a barn out back with a cow two pigs three ducks and a yack. Life on the farm wasn't always this way. Everything changed just last saturday.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0131.wav|When riding her bicycle down the street a terrier means a dog taste Mrs. Browns feet.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0135.wav|They rang the doorbell to hear the chims, flushed the toilet one hundred times. That's really crazy
wavs/robyn_robyn_0136.wav|...raced up the stairs, came sliding back down, each one wearing a different gown.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0137.wav|...took turns bouncing on Mrs. Brown's bed, painted the house in matching barn red.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0138.wav|They rided th the pantry
wavs/robyn_robyn_0139.wav|They raided the pantry, prepared a snack for a cow two pigs three ducks and a yack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0140.wav|In the bathroom they played for hours, putting on makeup and taking long shoers showers.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0141.wav|They dried off in front of a roaring fire, warm and cozy but beginning to tire. Fire and tire rhyme. Tip toed upstairs by candle light, borrow pajamas to wear for the night.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0142.wav|The hospital released Mrs. Brown.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0143.wav|...at eight. A taxi cab dropped her off by the gate.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0144.wav|She hobbled upstairs and crawled in the sack, didn't see a cow two pigs three ducks and a yack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0145.wav|The floor beneath them began to crack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0146.wav|The four walls and windows start to shake.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0147.wav|All this commotion woke Mr. Brown.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0148.wav|...in time to feel her bed crashing down. The police were first to arrive on the scene.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0149.wav|Fire f trucks dispatched from station thirteen. An ambulance raced all the way from town and cra carried away poor Mr. Brown.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0150.wav|In the hospital she lay on her her back with a cow two pigs three ducks and a yack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0152.wav|In a taxi they cramped all eight.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0153.wav|The driver dropped them off by the gate. He sweeped out the feathers and
wavs/robyn_robyn_0154.wav|hair and

wavs/robyn_robyn_0156.wav|Life on farm wasn't always this way until Mr. Brown Mrs. Brown went to town that day. So now she lives in a barn out back with a cow two pigs three ducks and a yack. That's it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0158.wav|Father, he said, buy me a microscope, please.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0159.wav|What for? asked his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0160.wav|So I can see tiny things, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0161.wav|Can't you see
wavs/robyn_robyn_0163.wav|Look at this spot.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0164.wav|It is tiny.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0165.wav|Look at this ant.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0166.wav|It is tiny.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0167.wav|What do you want to see?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0168.wav|Well, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0169.wav|Billy has a microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0170.wav|It came in a box with some glass slides.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0171.wav|He can see the hairs on a spider's foot.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0172.wav|He can see the little hooks in a bird's feather.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0173.wav|They are tiny. But they look big under the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0174.wav|I want to see those things, too.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0175.wav|Can't you look through Billy's microscope? asked Greg's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0176.wav|He is using it. I need my own, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0177.wav|I will have to think about that, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0178.wav|Microscopes cost a lot of money.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0179.wav|Oh, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0180.wav|Billy's father didn't not pay a lot.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0181.wav|I will speak to him, said Greg's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0182.wav|Greg's father
wavs/robyn_robyn_0184.wav|Then he began to shop for a microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0185.wav|He went to the toy stores.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0186.wav|He went to the big dar department stores.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0187.wav|He went to a pa p place where they sold.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0188.wav|sold used microscopes.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0189.wav|He came home with a big box. Greg, he called.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0190.wav|Greg came running. What is in the box? he said asked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0191.wav|Open it
wavs/robyn_robyn_0192.wav|it and see,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0193.wav|his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0194.wav|Greg opened the box.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0196.wav|What a microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0197.wav|Did you pay a lot? Greg asked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0198.wav|Not too much, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0199.wav|Greg's father put the microscope on the table in front of the window.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0200.wav|Look into it, he asked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0201.wav|Greg sat down. He looked into it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0202.wav|I can't see anything.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0203.wav|It is all dark, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0205.wav|ss said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0206.wav|Greg moved the mirror.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0207.wav|I can see
wavs/robyn_robyn_0210.wav|said his father. Look at at tiny things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0211.wav|Greg sat still.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0212.wav|Didn't you buy some slides for me to
wavs/robyn_robyn_0213.wav|look at? No, Greg, said his f his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0214.wav|Find your own tiny things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0215.wav|What shall I look at? asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0216.wav|What is tiny? He ran into the kitchen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0217.wav|Mother, he said,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0220.wav|His mother was holding
wavs/robyn_robyn_0221.wav|the salt box. Try some salt, he said
wavs/robyn_robyn_0222.wav|she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0224.wav|He put some salt on it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0225.wav|The he went to the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0226.wav|He put the slide on.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0227.wav|Wait, called Greg's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0228.wav|I will show you how to use it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0229.wav|He showed Greg
wavs/robyn_robyn_0230.wav|how to move the wheels until he could see the salt.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0231.wav|The salt looks like big blocks, Greg said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0232.wav|Well, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0233.wav|The salt looks hundred times bigger than it really is.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0234.wav|Hundred times bigger!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0235.wav|said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0237.wav|She looked through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0238.wav|My goodness, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0239.wav|The salt looks like rocks.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0240.wav|Come into the kitchen, Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0241.wav|Let's look for more tiny things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0242.wav|Greg did not go right away. He just
wavs/robyn_robyn_0243.wav|keep looking
wavs/robyn_robyn_0245.wav|Add some water, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0246.wav|Greg got some water and put a drop on the salt.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0247.wav|Then he looked into the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0248.wav|Father, he cried,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0249.wav|the salt is
wavs/robyn_robyn_0250.wav|getting smaller and smaller.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0251.wav|It's going.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0252.wav|It's going. It's gone!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0253.wav|My salt is gone! said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0254.wav|greg
wavs/robyn_robyn_0255.wav|Where did it go?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0256.wav|Put the slide in the sun. Let it dry.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0257.wav|Greg put the slide in the sun.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0259.wav|and went into the kitchen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0260.wav|Let's try some sugar, he said
wavs/robyn_robyn_0261.wav|to his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0262.wav|Greg's mother gave him some sugar.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0263.wav|Greg put it on the slide.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0264.wav|Then he went back to look at it through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0265.wav|Sugar looks like blocks, too. But these blocks are not as even as the salt blocks, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0266.wav|Add some water, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0267.wav|No, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0268.wav|I lost the salt.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0269.wav|I will lose the sugar, too.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0270.wav|See if your salt slide is dry, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0272.wav|Father, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0273.wav|The salt came out of the water.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0274.wav|It is back on the slide. But it looks different.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0275.wav|You get better crystals.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0276.wav|You get better crystals when they form in water, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0278.wav|What are they?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0279.wav|Look at them and see, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0280.wav|Greg put the slide on the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0282.wav|The salt looks like glass blocks now.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0283.wav|Let me look, said his father, and call Mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0284.wav|Greg went to get his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0285.wav|His mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0286.wav|Mother looked through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0287.wav|Almost like diamonds, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0288.wav|That's right, said Greg's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0289.wav|Every thing little crystals of sugar.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0290.wav|Every little crystal of sugar and salt
wavs/robyn_robyn_0291.wav|has sharp corners, just like diamonds.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0292.wav|Do all crystals have sharp corners? asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0293.wav|Yes, said his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0296.wav|Said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0298.wav|He looked through the microscope. Each little block.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0300.wav|Going gone, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0301.wav|He put the slide in the sun.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0302.wav|He looked at it when it was dry. The sugar looked like glass flau flowers.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0303.wav|What beautiful crystals, Greg said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0304.wav|Now let's look at at pepper.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0305.wav|He put some pepper on a slide and looked at it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0306.wav|No crystals he.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0308.wav|Pepper looks like dirt.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0309.wav|The next day was a holiday.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0311.wav|Come and see my new microscope, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0312.wav|This is a good one, Billy said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0313.wav|Let me see some slides, I.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0314.wav|I made my own, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0315.wav|And he showed Billy the salt and sugar slides.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0316.wav|Billy looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0317.wav|Those are crystals, says Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0318.wav|Ever.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0319.wav|Every little crystal of sugar and salt has sharp corners, like diamonds.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0321.wav|No, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0322.wav|Look at pepper.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0323.wav|Billy looked at the pepper.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0324.wav|Let's look at more things, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0325.wav|How about flour?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0326.wav|Did you look at flour?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0327.wav|How about butter? And milk?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0328.wav|One thing at a time, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0330.wav|Add a drop of water, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0331.wav|Will the flour go into the water? asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0332.wav|I don't know, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0333.wav|Greg put water on the flour.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0334.wav|He looked through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0335.wav|No, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0336.wav|The flour stays there. Don't you have a cover glass?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0337.wav|asked Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0338.wav|Put a cover glass.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0339.wav|On.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0340.wav|Why? asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0341.wav|You will see better, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0342.wav|Greg started to put the cover glass.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0344.wav|Billy watched.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0345.wav|Don't plop it on, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0346.wav|Why not? asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0347.wav|You will get too many air bubbles, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0348.wav|Good! I want to see what they look like, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0349.wav|Oh, you will see, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0350.wav|Just plop the cover.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0351.wav|Glass on Greg did just that.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0352.wav|Then he looked at the slide.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0353.wav|What are those big black circles asked Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0354.wav|Air bubbles, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0355.wav|I like them! said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0356.wav|Where.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0358.wav|Let me see.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0359.wav|Said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0360.wav|Those little clear things must be the flour.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0361.wav|Just then Greg's mother came in.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0362.wav|Flour? she said. Let me see what it looks like.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0363.wav|I see black rings.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0364.wav|I see black rings.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0365.wav|Those are air bubbles, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0366.wav|Look between them.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0367.wav|You will see little clear things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0368.wav|A that is the flour.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0369.wav|Greg said his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0370.wav|Greg said to his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0371.wav|You know so much.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0372.wav|Oh, not so much, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0373.wav|And he looked at Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0374.wav|Greg's mother sat down to sju.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0375.wav|Greg and Billy keep looking at different things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0376.wav|They looked at butter.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0377.wav|They looked at milk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0378.wav|They looked at dust.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0379.wav|Every minute Greg's mother heard the boys say, Oh, look at this.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0380.wav|Woah, see this.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0381.wav|Then they were standing near her.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0382.wav|May we look at your thread?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0383.wav|They asked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0384.wav|Sure, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0385.wav|Here is a piece of cotton thread.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0386.wav|Greg took the thread.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0387.wav|He made a slide and looked at it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0388.wav|This is the best yet.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0389.wav|This isn't the best yet, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0391.wav|Look, Mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0392.wav|Greg's mother looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0393.wav|Billy looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0394.wav|The cotton thread was ra really many threads twisted together.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0395.wav|This is wonderful, said Greg's mum.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0396.wav|Try some of my wool.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0397.wav|Greg put a piece of wool under the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0398.wav|Each wool thread was really men really many threads twist together.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0399.wav|But look, Billy, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0400.wav|Look at one of the wool threads.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0401.wav|It has scales all over it, like fish scales.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0402.wav|Billy looked. Hmm, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0403.wav|Maybe all hair hair looks like that.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0404.wav|Hair, cried Greg. What has has hair to do with wool?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0406.wav|Greg thought. From sheep, he yelled.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0407.wav|I get it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0408.wav|Wool is sheep hair. So there, said Billy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0409.wav|On Monday Greg came home from school. He had an idea.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0410.wav|I am going to look at other hairs, he said to his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0411.wav|He pulled hair from his head.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0412.wav|Now I will see what it looks like, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0413.wav|He made a slide.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0414.wav|He looked at his hair.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0415.wav|Does it look like wool? asked his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0416.wav|Greg looked at his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0417.wav|I am not a sheep, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0419.wav|His mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0420.wav|I wonder what I a god a dog's hair looks like.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0421.wav|Mother, said Greg. You wonder almost as much as I do.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0422.wav|Where will I find a dog?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0423.wav|Just then the doorbell rang.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0424.wav|Greg went to the door.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0426.wav|Greg looked at her dog.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0427.wav|Sure, Mrs. Broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0428.wav|Come in. Please, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0429.wav|Oh, hello, Mrs. Broom, said Greg's mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0430.wav|Greg!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0431.wav|greg! A dog! Just in time.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0432.wav|May we have one of Coco's hairs.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0433.wav|Mrs. Broom? Greg one.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0434.wav|May we have one of Coco's hair, Mrs. Broom?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0435.wav|Greg wants to look at it through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0436.wav|Well, in that case, said Mrs. Broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0437.wav|Well in the case that said Mrs. Brow Broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0438.wav|She looked at the sleeve of her coat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0439.wav|Her.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0440.wav|Here are a few few, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0441.wav|Greg took the hair.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0442.wav|He put them on a slide with water and a cover slip.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0443.wav|Greg looked at the slide.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0444.wav|Let me see, said his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0445.wav|I want to see my dog's hair, said Mrs. Broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0446.wav|One at a time, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0447.wav|One at a time.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0448.wav|Mrs. Broom looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0449.wav|His mu.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0450.wav|His mother looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0451.wav|It's hard to believe, said Mrs. Broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0452.wav|One little hair.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0453.wav|Look like a long pole.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0454.wav|Greg looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0455.wav|Looked at Coco.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0456.wav|Don't you want to look too? he asked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0457.wav|But Coco just wagged his tail.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0458.wav|One day Greg said to his mother, my teacher wants me to bring my microscope to school.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0459.wav|Don't.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0460.wav|They have one? asked his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0462.wav|Well, carry it ev it very careful lee, said his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0463.wav|Greg took the microscpe to school.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0464.wav|When he came home, he said, mother, the teacher showed us how every living thing is made of seals.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0465.wav|Seals? said Greg's mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0467.wav|Well, show me, said Greg's mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0468.wav|Let's get an onion, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0469.wav|He peeled off the thin clear skin from a piece of onion.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0470.wav|He made a slide and looked at it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0471.wav|See, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0472.wav|There are the se seals.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0473.wav|Greg's mother looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0474.wav|They are like bricks in a wall, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0475.wav|I'll show you my seals, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0476.wav|Don't cut yourself, said his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0477.wav|I won't. Just watch.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0479.wav|Greg took a tooth pin.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0480.wav|Tooth pin he rubbed.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0481.wav|And the end of it on the sa inside of his mouth.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0482.wav|Then he rubbed that end an in a drop of water on a slide.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0484.wav|Then he looked through the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0485.wav|Here, Mother, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0486.wav|These are my very own seals.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0487.wav|His mother looked. That what nice cells, she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0488.wav|Greg had a new idea.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0489.wav|I'm going to look at the leaves in my fish tank, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0490.wav|Maybe I will see seals there, too.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0492.wav|Green bricks, he called to his mother.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0493.wav|Then he moved the slide to see the edge of the leaf.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0494.wav|Things are moving there.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0495.wav|Things are moving here, he cried.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0496.wav|Just then Greg's father came home.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0497.wav|What's for dinner? he asked. I'm hungry.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0498.wav|Greg's mother went to the kitchen dinner.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0499.wav|Dinner will will be ready soon he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0500.wav|she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0501.wav|See what Greg has under the microscope.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0502.wav|Take a look, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0503.wav|It is the busiest play pl place you ever saw.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0504.wav|Greg's father looked.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0505.wav|Those are animals, Greg, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0506.wav|And each animal is just one single cell.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0507.wav|I just learned about seals, said Greg.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0508.wav|But I didn't know there could be a whole animal of just one seal!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0509.wav|There must be a hundred of them on that one leaf.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0510.wav|This far. His father keep looking.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0511.wav|He looked and looked. Greg waited his mother came into the room.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0512.wav|Did you see this? asked Greg's father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0513.wav|No, let me see she said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0514.wav|Down to look Greg waited.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0515.wav|Then he looked at his father.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0517.wav|Wilma the witch has a crazy broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0518.wav|It likes to fly around her room.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0519.wav|She also has a fat cat and a pet rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0520.wav|Wilma loves her pet rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0521.wav|She calls the rat my little brat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0522.wav|The rat hatis the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0523.wav|The cat does not care.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0524.wav|The cat, who's fat, just lies in the vat and stares a at the rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0525.wav|The rat hates that.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0526.wav|One night, when Wilma was out, the fat cat got out of the vat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0527.wav|He went, pit a pat
wavs/robyn_robyn_0528.wav|And sat on the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0529.wav|This is my mat! said the rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0530.wav|So what, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0531.wav|So get off! said the rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0532.wav|No I won't, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0534.wav|It will get you off the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0535.wav|No it won't, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0536.wav|This is the ma mat of the rat
wavs/robyn_robyn_0538.wav|So what, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0539.wav|So get off! said the bat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0540.wav|No I won't, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0541.wav|Then I will go and get my hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0542.wav|Said the rat bat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0543.wav|Said the bat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0544.wav|It will get out of the.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0545.wav|you get you ow off that ma the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0546.wav|No it won't, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0548.wav|So what, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0549.wav|So get off! said the sh said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0550.wav|No I won't, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0551.wav|I am a cat, and I am fat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0554.wav|We shall see, said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0557.wav|Big deal, a dish, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0558.wav|A dish and wheat else? asked the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0559.wav|Hmmm a fish! said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0560.wav|A fish on a dish, said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0561.wav|For me? asked the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0562.wav|Yes, for you, said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0563.wav|Bring it closer, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0565.wav|You think I am stupid, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0566.wav|You want to get me off the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0567.wav|I won't get off, and that is that!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0568.wav|Ratatat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0570.wav|I don't know, said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0571.wav|Ratatat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0572.wav|It sounds like a rat with a tat, said the cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0573.wav|It's not me, said the bat rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0574.wav|It's not me, said the rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0575.wav|What is a tat? asked the bat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0576.wav|I don't know, said the hat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0577.wav|Look! The broom!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0578.wav|Look! The broom! cried the rat the bat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0579.wav|The broom flew into the room.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0580.wav|It zoomed over the mat,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0581.wav|over the cat,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0582.wav|over the hat and
wavs/robyn_robyn_0584.wav|It landed on the hat,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0585.wav|which landed on the bat,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0586.wav|who landed on the rat,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0587.wav|who landed on the cat, lying flat on the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0589.wav|No we won't! said the hat and the bat and the ha rat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0591.wav|Wilma came home. She looked at the room. She picked up the broom.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0592.wav|Then she asked, Why is th fish out of the dish?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0594.wav|My dear little brat, said Wilma,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0595.wav|what makes you think this is your mat?
wavs/robyn_robyn_0596.wav|The fat cat smiled.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0597.wav|The fat cat got up and stretched, off.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0599.wav|Ate the fish, licked the dish, and went back to lie down in the vat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0600.wav|Thank goodness! said the mat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0601.wav|The end.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0602.wav|Okay, ready.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0603.wav|If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0604.wav|When you give him a milk
wavs/robyn_robyn_0605.wav|He'll probably ask for a a straw.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0606.wav|When he's finished, he'll ask for a napkin.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0607.wav|Then he'll want to look in a mirror
wavs/robyn_robyn_0609.wav|When he looks into the mirror,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0612.wav|When he's finished giving himself a ss a trim,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0613.wav|he'll want a broom to sweep up.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0614.wav|He'll start sweeping.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0615.wav|He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0616.wav|He may even end up washing the floors as well!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0617.wav|When he he's done, he'll probably want to take a nap.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0618.wav|You'll have to fix up a little box for him
wavs/robyn_robyn_0619.wav|with a blanket and a pillow.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0620.wav|He'll crawl
wavs/robyn_robyn_0621.wav|He'll crawl in make
wavs/robyn_robyn_0622.wav|In.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0623.wav|make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0624.wav|He.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0625.wav|He'll probably ask you to read him a story.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0626.wav|So you'll read to him from one of your books,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0627.wav|and he'll ask to see pictures.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0628.wav|When he looks at the pictures, he'll get too so excited he'll want to draw one of his own.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0629.wav|He'll ask for paper and some crayons.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0630.wav|He'll draw a picture.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0631.wav|When the picture is finished, he'll want to sigggn his name
wavs/robyn_robyn_0632.wav|with a pen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0633.wav|Then he'll want to hang his picture on your refrigerator. Which means he'll need
wavs/robyn_robyn_0634.wav|Scotch tape.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0636.wav|Looking at the refrigerator
wavs/robyn_robyn_0637.wav|will remind him that
wavs/robyn_robyn_0638.wav|he's thirsty. So.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0639.wav|he'll ask for a glass of milk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0640.wav|And changes.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0641.wav|Chances or are if he asks for a glass of milk,
wavs/robyn_robyn_0642.wav|he's going to want a cookie to go with.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0643.wav|Finished.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0644.wav|Isn't it a beautiful day mum, Christy Tate.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0645.wav|Christy Tate asked happily.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0646.wav|She gasped out of
wavs/robyn_robyn_0647.wav|the car.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0648.wav|Window at the blue sky and sunshine.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0649.wav|Do you think it will stay like this for all of summer vacation?

wavs/robyn_robyn_0917.wav|In the house lived many cats who called out to Pickles, You are bad.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0918.wav|You cannot be our friend.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0919.wav|But Pickles did have a friend in the house.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0920.wav|His friend was Mrs. Goodkind.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0921.wav|Every day Mrs. Goodkind came into the yard and gave Pickles something to eat.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0931.wav|He began to chase the little cats again.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0932.wav|Mrs. Goodkind said to Pickles, things cannot go on like this. Something will happen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0933.wav|The next day Pickles chased a little cat up an an up an old tree. He climbed after her.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0934.wav|Pickles sat up in the tree near the little cat.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0946.wav|Mrs. Goodkind Goodkind ran to the tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0947.wav|Pickles! she called. Please try to climb down.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0948.wav|But Pickles could not climb down.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0949.wav|Mrs. Goodkind ran into her house. Pickles could not see her by the window.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0958.wav|The firemen put a ladder against the tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0959.wav|One of the firemen began to climb up the ladder.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0960.wav|The fireman climbed to the top of the ladder.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0961.wav|Come cat, he said he.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0962.wav|Come cat, he said to Pickles. Let me help you.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0963.wav|The fireman picked up Pickles and took him into his coat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0964.wav|Then he took Pickles down the ladder, down mi to Mrs. Goodkind.

wavs/robyn_robyn_0966.wav|No, Joe, said Mrs. Goodkind. Pickles has no home, and he does not want to live with me.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0967.wav|Why? Asked Joe.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0968.wav|Mrs. Goodkind answered, My home is too little for Pickles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0970.wav|Look at his big paws.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0971.wav|Pickles put out a paw for Joe to see.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0972.wav|My goodness, Pickles, said Joe.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0973.wav|What big paws you have!
wavs/robyn_robyn_0974.wav|Pickles looked at Joe.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0975.wav|and said the one word he could say:

wavs/robyn_robyn_0977.wav|Joe gave Pickles a pat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0978.wav|Pickles, he said. I will take you to our firehouse. Maybe your sh our Chief will let us let you stay.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0979.wav|The Fire Cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0980.wav|The Fire Cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0981.wav|Joe took Pickles to the Chief, who was sitting at his desk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0982.wav|Oh! said the Chief. I know this young cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0983.wav|He is the one a who chases little cats.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0984.wav|How do you know? asked Joe.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0985.wav|The Chief answered, A Fire Chief knows many things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0986.wav|Just then the telephone began to ring.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0989.wav|Well, we shall see. Thank you, Mrs. Goodkind. Good-bye.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0990.wav|The Chief looked at Pickles and said, Mrs. Goodkind says you are not a bad cat. And Joe likes you.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0991.wav|I will let you live here if you will learn to be a good firehouse cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0992.wav|Pickles wa Pickles walked quietly up the stairs after Joe.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0993.wav|Joe and Pickles went into a room where the firemen lived.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0995.wav|They wanted to play with Pickles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0996.wav|But suddenly the fire bell rang. All the firemen ran to the big a big pole and down they wa went.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0997.wav|The pole was the fast way to get to their trucks.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0998.wav|Pickles could hear the trucks start up and rush off the fire.
wavs/robyn_robyn_0999.wav|Pickles said to himself, I must learn to do what the firemen do.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1000.wav|I must learn to slide down the pole.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1001.wav|He jumped and put his paws around the pole.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1002.wav|Down the down he fell with a bump.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1003.wav|Bumps or no bumps, I must try again said Pickles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1004.wav|Up the stairs he ran.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1005.wav|Down the pole he came and bumped, he tried again.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1006.wav|And bumped.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1008.wav|What a wonderful cat you are! said the firemen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1009.wav|The Chief did not say anything.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1010.wav|Pickles said to himself, I must keep on learning everything I can.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1011.wav|So he learned to jump up one on one of the big trucks.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1012.wav|And he learned to sit up straight to on the seat while the truck raced to a fire.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1013.wav|What a wonderful cat you are said the firemen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1014.wav|The Chief did not say anything.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1016.wav|At the next fire, he jumped down from the truck.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1017.wav|He ran to a big ha.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1018.wav|Whose.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1019.wav|put his paws around it, and tried to help a fireman
wavs/robyn_robyn_1020.wav|shoot the water at the flames.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1021.wav|He ran to a big whose, put his paws around it, and tried to help a fireman
wavs/robyn_robyn_1022.wav|shoot the water at the flames.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1023.wav|What a wonderful cat you are! said the firemen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1024.wav|The Chief did not say anything.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1025.wav|The Chief called all the firemen to his desk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1026.wav|Then he called for Pickles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1027.wav|Pickles did not know what was going to happen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1028.wav|He said to himself, Maybe the Chief does not like the way I work.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1029.wav|Maybe he wants to send me back to my old yard.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1030.wav|But Pickles went to the Chief.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1031.wav|At the Chief's desk stood all the firemen - and Mrs. Goodkind!
wavs/robyn_robyn_1033.wav|Pickles jumped up on my desk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1034.wav|I have something to say to you, Pickles jump
wavs/robyn_robyn_1035.wav|To you pickles jump on the desk and looked at the Chief. Out of the desk the Chief took
wavs/robyn_robyn_1036.wav|A hat a little fire hat!
wavs/robyn_robyn_1037.wav|Pickles, said the Chief, he have watched you are at your work.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1038.wav|I have watched you at your work.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1039.wav|You have worked hard.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1040.wav|The time has come come for you to know that you are now our Fire Cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1041.wav|And with these words, the Chief put the little a hat on Pickles' head.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1042.wav|The Old Tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1043.wav|Pickles made friends, with all the firemen. But the he did not make friends with any cats. When
wavs/robyn_robyn_1044.wav|When cats came to the firehouse to look at the trucks, people, Pickles chased them away.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1045.wav|The Chief called Pickles Pickles to him and said A Fire Cat must be kind to everyone.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1046.wav|You must be good to other cats.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1047.wav|Little by little, Pickles learned to be good to the cats he met me he met.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1048.wav|He, to be good to the cats he met.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1049.wav|He made friends with then them too.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1050.wav|Then all the cats loved to come to the firehouse.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1051.wav|On rainy days, on rainy days, most cats stayed at home, and Pickles sat upstairs with the firemen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1052.wav|One rainy day, as he sat there, he thought to himself How bad I was.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1053.wav|One cold morning, Dragon went out to find the perfect Christmas tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1054.wav|He walked through the crunchy snow.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1055.wav|He saw all sorts of trees.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1056.wav|Crude ones, and straight ones.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1057.wav|Finally, he found the most beautiful Christmas tree of all.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1058.wav|It was not too big, or too small.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1059.wav|It was not too crude, or too straight.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1060.wav|It was just right.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1061.wav|Dragon looked down and ss saw the tree's beautiful
wavs/robyn_robyn_1062.wav|brown trunk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1063.wav|It stood firm and strong in the frozen earth.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1064.wav|He looked up and saw its beautiful green branches.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1065.wav|They waved back and forth in the cold December, wind.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1066.wav|Dragon could not cut down ss such a lovely tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1067.wav|Instead he came back with colored lights, silver bell and everything he needed to make his tree even more beautiful.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1068.wav|That night dra, that night Dragon looked out at his Christmas tree shining in the night. It was truly perfect.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1069.wav|The candy reth.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1070.wav|One day in December Dragon had a good idea.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1071.wav|I will make a reth out of candy, he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1072.wav|Dragon took some old wire and bent it into shape.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1073.wav|Then he taped little pieces of chocolate candy and all around it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1074.wav|When Dragon hung his candy reth one on the wall, the, one of the pieces of chocolate fell off.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1075.wav|Dragon picked it up and ate it.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1076.wav|It was very good.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1077.wav|Dragon did not want his reth to look bare, so he promised not to eat any more candy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1078.wav|I will eat only the pieces that fall off,
wavs/robyn_robyn_1079.wav|ss he said.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1080.wav|Dragon bumped his elbow against the wall
wavs/robyn_robyn_1081.wav|and two more pieces of candy tell.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1082.wav|Dragon sat down in his chair and looked
wavs/robyn_robyn_1083.wav|up at his candy reth.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1084.wav|He tried not to think about the smooth, rich, sweet creamy, dark chocolate candy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1085.wav|Dragon could not sit still.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1086.wav|He began to drool.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1087.wav|Suddenly, Dragon could not stop himself.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1090.wav|Dragon got a tummy ache from eating so much chocolate.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1091.wav|Next year, said Dragon, I will make my reth out of pin pine cones.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1092.wav|Dragon was always losing his mittens.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1093.wav|No matter how hard he tried, he could never keep track of them.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1094.wav|Whenever he needed them most, they were nowhere to be found.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1095.wav|So Dragon went and bought out and bought a pair of clip on mittens.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1096.wav|He clipped them to his coat sleeves, he he c would never lose his mittens again.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1097.wav|Merry Christmas dar Dragon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1098.wav|Dragon loved Christmas.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1099.wav|Every year he saved his money, and every Christmas he bought wonderful presents for himself.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1100.wav|Dragon made a list of things he would buy.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1101.wav|Lots of food, a new coat, a big birdhouse.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1103.wav|Then Dragon finished his Christmas shopping
wavs/robyn_robyn_1104.wav|the store clerk loaded everything into a big sack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1105.wav|On his way home, Dragon passed some raccoons singing in the street.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1106.wav|The raccoons had no food to eat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1107.wav|they looked very hungry.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1108.wav|Dragon reached into his sack.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1109.wav|Out his big basket of food.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1110.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1111.wav|Then he passed an old reehun shoveling her sidewalk.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1112.wav|The reehun did not have a coat to wear.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1113.wav|She looked very cold.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1114.wav|Dragon reached into his sack and took out his new wool overcoat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1115.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1116.wav|Finally, Dragon saw two little birds si sitting on a branch.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1117.wav|The birds did not have a home to live in.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1118.wav|They looked very sad.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1119.wav|Dragon opened his big sack took out his birdhouse, and hung it on branch.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1120.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1121.wav|When Dragon got home, his big sack was empty.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1122.wav|There were no presents left for him.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1123.wav|But Dragon did not feel sad.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1124.wav|He went upstairs to his quiet room and crawled beneath his soft warm quilt.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1125.wav|And later as he slept, Dragon dreamed he heard angels singing in the stairy night.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1126.wav|But I was wrong. I think we need three microscopes for this family.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1127.wav|How bad I was when I chased the other cats.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1128.wav|Once I chased a little cat up a tree. Oh, me! Oh, my!
wavs/robyn_robyn_1129.wav|Up a tree oh, me! Oh, my!
wavs/robyn_robyn_1130.wav|We didn't a, why did I do that?
wavs/robyn_robyn_1131.wav|Suddenly Pickles heard the Chief call out, Cat in a tree!
wavs/robyn_robyn_1133.wav|Pickles slid down after them.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1134.wav|He heard the Chief say The tree is in the old yard next to Mrs. Goodkind's house.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1135.wav|Oh, thought Pickles. That's the yard where I lived. And that's the tree.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1136.wav|The that's the tree Pickles jumped, Pickles jumped up an, on the truck with the three firemen.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1137.wav|Away they rode to the yard. And he, and there there, in the wind and the rain, stood Mrs. Goodkind, pointing to a very little cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1138.wav|The firemen put the firemen put a ladder against the tree. The ladder scared the little cat, and she ran to ha a high branch,
wavs/robyn_robyn_1139.wav|where a fireman could not go. Joe said to Mrs. Goodkind, I don't know what to do. But Pickles knew knew.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1140.wav|He began to climb the ladder.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1141.wav|Pickles climbed up and up and up.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1142.wav|It was hard work. But at last he came to the top of the ladder.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1143.wav|Then he climbed up the tree until he came to the tree to the little cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1145.wav|He picked her up and took her gently down to Mrs. Good.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1146.wav|Mrs. Goodkind thanked Pickles.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1147.wav|Then he sh then she said to him, I always knew that some day you would do a big things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1148.wav|I always knew that someday you would do big things.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1149.wav|Today you have done something very big.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1150.wav|Pickles waved a paw at her.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1151.wav|As if to stay, Mrs. Goodkind.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1152.wav|Mrs. Goodkind, as, as if to stay, Mrs. Goodkind, this is only a beginning.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1153.wav|And he rode home to the firehouse a proud and happy cat.
wavs/robyn_robyn_1154.wav|The end.
