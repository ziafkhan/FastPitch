wavs/robyn_robyn_0007.wav|Dragon loved to go shopping. He was a very wise shopper.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0008.wav|He bought food only from the five basic groups.|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0016.wav|He had so much food that he could not fit it all into his car|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0017.wav|I know what I will do said dragon.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0018.wav|I will eat some of the food now and the rest will fit in the car.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0019.wav|Dragon sat in the parking lot|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0021.wav|Dragon sat in the parking lot and started to eat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0022.wav|He crunched up the cheese curls, he donated the doughnuts, he packed away the pork riiinds.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0023.wav|Dragon ate and ate and ate until all the food was gone.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0024.wav|burp|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0028.wav|I know what I will do, said dragon, I will push my car home|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0029.wav|So dragon pushed his car down the hill.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0030.wav|So dragon pushed his car down the hill.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0031.wav|The car began to roll. Faster and faster and faster and faster.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0033.wav|Right in front of his house.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0034.wav|All the excitement had made dragon very hungry.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0035.wav|He went into his kitchen|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0036.wav|and looked in the cupboard.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0037.wav|There was no food at all. The cupboard is bare, said dragon. Time to go shopping.|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0159.wav|What for? asked his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0160.wav|So I can see tiny things, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0161.wav|Can't you see|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0163.wav|Look at this spot.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0164.wav|It is tiny.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0165.wav|Look at this ant.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0166.wav|It is tiny.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0167.wav|What do you want to see?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0168.wav|Well, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0169.wav|Billy has a microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0170.wav|It came in a box with some glass slides.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0171.wav|He can see the hairs on a spider's foot.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0172.wav|He can see the little hooks in a bird's feather.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0173.wav|They are tiny. But they look big under the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0174.wav|I want to see those things, too.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0175.wav|Can't you look through Billy's microscope? asked Greg's father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0176.wav|He is using it. I need my own, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0177.wav|I will have to think about that, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0178.wav|Microscopes cost a lot of money.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0179.wav|Oh, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0180.wav|Billy's father didn't not pay a lot.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0181.wav|I will speak to him, said Greg's father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0182.wav|Greg's father|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0184.wav|Then he began to shop for a microscope.|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0187.wav|He went to a pa p place where they sold.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0188.wav|sold used microscopes.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0189.wav|He came home with a big box. Greg, he called.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0190.wav|Greg came running. What is in the box? he said asked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0191.wav|Open it|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0192.wav|it and see,|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0194.wav|Greg opened the box.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0196.wav|What a microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0197.wav|Did you pay a lot? Greg asked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0198.wav|Not too much, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0199.wav|Greg's father put the microscope on the table in front of the window.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0200.wav|Look into it, he asked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0201.wav|Greg sat down. He looked into it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0202.wav|I can't see anything.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0203.wav|It is all dark, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0205.wav|ss said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0206.wav|Greg moved the mirror.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0207.wav|I can see|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0210.wav|said his father. Look at at tiny things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0211.wav|Greg sat still.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0212.wav|Didn't you buy some slides for me to|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0213.wav|look at? No, Greg, said his f his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0214.wav|Find your own tiny things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0215.wav|What shall I look at? asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0216.wav|What is tiny? He ran into the kitchen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0217.wav|Mother, he said,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0220.wav|His mother was holding|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0221.wav|the salt box. Try some salt, he said|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0222.wav|she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0224.wav|He put some salt on it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0225.wav|The he went to the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0226.wav|He put the slide on.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0227.wav|Wait, called Greg's father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0228.wav|I will show you how to use it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0229.wav|He showed Greg|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0230.wav|how to move the wheels until he could see the salt.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0231.wav|The salt looks like big blocks, Greg said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0232.wav|Well, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0233.wav|The salt looks hundred times bigger than it really is.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0234.wav|Hundred times bigger!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0235.wav|said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0237.wav|She looked through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0238.wav|My goodness, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0239.wav|The salt looks like rocks.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0240.wav|Come into the kitchen, Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0241.wav|Let's look for more tiny things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0242.wav|Greg did not go right away. He just|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0243.wav|keep looking|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0245.wav|Add some water, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0246.wav|Greg got some water and put a drop on the salt.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0247.wav|Then he looked into the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0248.wav|Father, he cried,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0249.wav|the salt is|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0250.wav|getting smaller and smaller.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0251.wav|It's going.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0252.wav|It's going. It's gone!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0253.wav|My salt is gone! said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0254.wav|greg|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0255.wav|Where did it go?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0256.wav|Put the slide in the sun. Let it dry.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0257.wav|Greg put the slide in the sun.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0259.wav|and went into the kitchen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0260.wav|Let's try some sugar, he said|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0261.wav|to his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0262.wav|Greg's mother gave him some sugar.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0263.wav|Greg put it on the slide.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0264.wav|Then he went back to look at it through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0265.wav|Sugar looks like blocks, too. But these blocks are not as even as the salt blocks, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0266.wav|Add some water, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0267.wav|No, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0268.wav|I lost the salt.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0269.wav|I will lose the sugar, too.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0270.wav|See if your salt slide is dry, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0272.wav|Father, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0273.wav|The salt came out of the water.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0274.wav|It is back on the slide. But it looks different.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0275.wav|You get better crystals.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0276.wav|You get better crystals when they form in water, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0278.wav|What are they?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0279.wav|Look at them and see, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0280.wav|Greg put the slide on the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0282.wav|The salt looks like glass blocks now.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0283.wav|Let me look, said his father, and call Mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0284.wav|Greg went to get his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0285.wav|His mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0286.wav|Mother looked through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0287.wav|Almost like diamonds, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0288.wav|That's right, said Greg's father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0289.wav|Every thing little crystals of sugar.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0290.wav|Every little crystal of sugar and salt|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0291.wav|has sharp corners, just like diamonds.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0292.wav|Do all crystals have sharp corners? asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0293.wav|Yes, said his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0296.wav|Said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0298.wav|He looked through the microscope. Each little block.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0300.wav|Going gone, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0301.wav|He put the slide in the sun.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0302.wav|He looked at it when it was dry. The sugar looked like glass flau flowers.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0303.wav|What beautiful crystals, Greg said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0304.wav|Now let's look at at pepper.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0305.wav|He put some pepper on a slide and looked at it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0306.wav|No crystals he.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0308.wav|Pepper looks like dirt.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0309.wav|The next day was a holiday.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0311.wav|Come and see my new microscope, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0312.wav|This is a good one, Billy said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0313.wav|Let me see some slides, I.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0314.wav|I made my own, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0315.wav|And he showed Billy the salt and sugar slides.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0316.wav|Billy looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0317.wav|Those are crystals, says Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0318.wav|Ever.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0319.wav|Every little crystal of sugar and salt has sharp corners, like diamonds.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0321.wav|No, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0322.wav|Look at pepper.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0323.wav|Billy looked at the pepper.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0324.wav|Let's look at more things, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0325.wav|How about flour?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0326.wav|Did you look at flour?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0327.wav|How about butter? And milk?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0328.wav|One thing at a time, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0330.wav|Add a drop of water, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0331.wav|Will the flour go into the water? asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0332.wav|I don't know, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0333.wav|Greg put water on the flour.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0334.wav|He looked through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0335.wav|No, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0336.wav|The flour stays there. Don't you have a cover glass?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0337.wav|asked Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0338.wav|Put a cover glass.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0339.wav|On.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0340.wav|Why? asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0341.wav|You will see better, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0342.wav|Greg started to put the cover glass.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0344.wav|Billy watched.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0345.wav|Don't plop it on, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0346.wav|Why not? asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0347.wav|You will get too many air bubbles, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0348.wav|Good! I want to see what they look like, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0349.wav|Oh, you will see, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0350.wav|Just plop the cover.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0351.wav|Glass on Greg did just that.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0352.wav|Then he looked at the slide.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0353.wav|What are those big black circles asked Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0354.wav|Air bubbles, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0355.wav|I like them! said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0356.wav|Where.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0358.wav|Let me see.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0359.wav|Said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0360.wav|Those little clear things must be the flour.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0361.wav|Just then Greg's mother came in.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0362.wav|Flour? she said. Let me see what it looks like.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0363.wav|I see black rings.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0364.wav|I see black rings.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0365.wav|Those are air bubbles, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0366.wav|Look between them.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0367.wav|You will see little clear things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0368.wav|A that is the flour.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0369.wav|Greg said his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0370.wav|Greg said to his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0371.wav|You know so much.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0372.wav|Oh, not so much, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0373.wav|And he looked at Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0374.wav|Greg's mother sat down to sju.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0375.wav|Greg and Billy keep looking at different things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0376.wav|They looked at butter.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0377.wav|They looked at milk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0378.wav|They looked at dust.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0379.wav|Every minute Greg's mother heard the boys say, Oh, look at this.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0380.wav|Woah, see this.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0381.wav|Then they were standing near her.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0382.wav|May we look at your thread?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0383.wav|They asked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0384.wav|Sure, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0385.wav|Here is a piece of cotton thread.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0386.wav|Greg took the thread.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0387.wav|He made a slide and looked at it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0388.wav|This is the best yet.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0389.wav|This isn't the best yet, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0391.wav|Look, Mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0392.wav|Greg's mother looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0393.wav|Billy looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0394.wav|The cotton thread was ra really many threads twisted together.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0395.wav|This is wonderful, said Greg's mum.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0396.wav|Try some of my wool.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0397.wav|Greg put a piece of wool under the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0398.wav|Each wool thread was really men really many threads twist together.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0399.wav|But look, Billy, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0400.wav|Look at one of the wool threads.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0401.wav|It has scales all over it, like fish scales.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0402.wav|Billy looked. Hmm, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0403.wav|Maybe all hair hair looks like that.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0404.wav|Hair, cried Greg. What has has hair to do with wool?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0406.wav|Greg thought. From sheep, he yelled.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0407.wav|I get it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0408.wav|Wool is sheep hair. So there, said Billy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0409.wav|On Monday Greg came home from school. He had an idea.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0410.wav|I am going to look at other hairs, he said to his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0411.wav|He pulled hair from his head.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0412.wav|Now I will see what it looks like, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0413.wav|He made a slide.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0414.wav|He looked at his hair.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0415.wav|Does it look like wool? asked his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0416.wav|Greg looked at his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0417.wav|I am not a sheep, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0419.wav|His mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0420.wav|I wonder what I a god a dog's hair looks like.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0421.wav|Mother, said Greg. You wonder almost as much as I do.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0422.wav|Where will I find a dog?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0423.wav|Just then the doorbell rang.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0424.wav|Greg went to the door.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0426.wav|Greg looked at her dog.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0427.wav|Sure, Mrs. Broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0428.wav|Come in. Please, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0429.wav|Oh, hello, Mrs. Broom, said Greg's mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0430.wav|Greg!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0431.wav|greg! A dog! Just in time.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0432.wav|May we have one of Coco's hairs.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0433.wav|Mrs. Broom? Greg one.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0434.wav|May we have one of Coco's hair, Mrs. Broom?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0435.wav|Greg wants to look at it through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0436.wav|Well, in that case, said Mrs. Broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0437.wav|Well in the case that said Mrs. Brow Broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0438.wav|She looked at the sleeve of her coat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0439.wav|Her.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0440.wav|Here are a few few, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0441.wav|Greg took the hair.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0442.wav|He put them on a slide with water and a cover slip.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0443.wav|Greg looked at the slide.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0444.wav|Let me see, said his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0445.wav|I want to see my dog's hair, said Mrs. Broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0446.wav|One at a time, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0447.wav|One at a time.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0448.wav|Mrs. Broom looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0449.wav|His mu.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0450.wav|His mother looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0451.wav|It's hard to believe, said Mrs. Broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0452.wav|One little hair.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0453.wav|Look like a long pole.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0454.wav|Greg looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0455.wav|Looked at Coco.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0456.wav|Don't you want to look too? he asked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0457.wav|But Coco just wagged his tail.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0458.wav|One day Greg said to his mother, my teacher wants me to bring my microscope to school.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0459.wav|Don't.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0460.wav|They have one? asked his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0462.wav|Well, carry it ev it very careful lee, said his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0463.wav|Greg took the microscpe to school.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0464.wav|When he came home, he said, mother, the teacher showed us how every living thing is made of seals.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0465.wav|Seals? said Greg's mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0467.wav|Well, show me, said Greg's mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0468.wav|Let's get an onion, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0469.wav|He peeled off the thin clear skin from a piece of onion.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0470.wav|He made a slide and looked at it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0471.wav|See, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0472.wav|There are the se seals.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0473.wav|Greg's mother looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0474.wav|They are like bricks in a wall, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0475.wav|I'll show you my seals, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0476.wav|Don't cut yourself, said his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0477.wav|I won't. Just watch.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0479.wav|Greg took a tooth pin.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0480.wav|Tooth pin he rubbed.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0481.wav|And the end of it on the sa inside of his mouth.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0482.wav|Then he rubbed that end an in a drop of water on a slide.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0484.wav|Then he looked through the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0485.wav|Here, Mother, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0486.wav|These are my very own seals.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0487.wav|His mother looked. That what nice cells, she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0488.wav|Greg had a new idea.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0489.wav|I'm going to look at the leaves in my fish tank, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0490.wav|Maybe I will see seals there, too.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0492.wav|Green bricks, he called to his mother.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0493.wav|Then he moved the slide to see the edge of the leaf.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0494.wav|Things are moving there.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0495.wav|Things are moving here, he cried.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0496.wav|Just then Greg's father came home.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0497.wav|What's for dinner? he asked. I'm hungry.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0498.wav|Greg's mother went to the kitchen dinner.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0499.wav|Dinner will will be ready soon he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0500.wav|she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0501.wav|See what Greg has under the microscope.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0502.wav|Take a look, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0503.wav|It is the busiest play pl place you ever saw.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0504.wav|Greg's father looked.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0505.wav|Those are animals, Greg, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0506.wav|And each animal is just one single cell.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0507.wav|I just learned about seals, said Greg.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0508.wav|But I didn't know there could be a whole animal of just one seal!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0509.wav|There must be a hundred of them on that one leaf.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0510.wav|This far. His father keep looking.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0511.wav|He looked and looked. Greg waited his mother came into the room.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0512.wav|Did you see this? asked Greg's father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0513.wav|No, let me see she said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0514.wav|Down to look Greg waited.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0515.wav|Then he looked at his father.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0517.wav|Wilma the witch has a crazy broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0518.wav|It likes to fly around her room.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0519.wav|She also has a fat cat and a pet rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0520.wav|Wilma loves her pet rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0521.wav|She calls the rat my little brat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0522.wav|The rat hatis the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0523.wav|The cat does not care.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0524.wav|The cat, who's fat, just lies in the vat and stares a at the rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0525.wav|The rat hates that.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0526.wav|One night, when Wilma was out, the fat cat got out of the vat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0527.wav|He went, pit a pat|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0528.wav|And sat on the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0529.wav|This is my mat! said the rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0530.wav|So what, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0531.wav|So get off! said the rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0532.wav|No I won't, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0534.wav|It will get you off the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0535.wav|No it won't, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0536.wav|This is the ma mat of the rat|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0538.wav|So what, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0539.wav|So get off! said the bat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0540.wav|No I won't, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0541.wav|Then I will go and get my hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0542.wav|Said the rat bat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0543.wav|Said the bat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0544.wav|It will get out of the.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0545.wav|you get you ow off that ma the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0546.wav|No it won't, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0548.wav|So what, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0549.wav|So get off! said the sh said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0550.wav|No I won't, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0551.wav|I am a cat, and I am fat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0554.wav|We shall see, said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0557.wav|Big deal, a dish, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0558.wav|A dish and wheat else? asked the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0559.wav|Hmmm a fish! said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0560.wav|A fish on a dish, said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0561.wav|For me? asked the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0562.wav|Yes, for you, said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0563.wav|Bring it closer, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0565.wav|You think I am stupid, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0566.wav|You want to get me off the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0567.wav|I won't get off, and that is that!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0568.wav|Ratatat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0570.wav|I don't know, said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0571.wav|Ratatat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0572.wav|It sounds like a rat with a tat, said the cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0573.wav|It's not me, said the bat rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0574.wav|It's not me, said the rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0575.wav|What is a tat? asked the bat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0576.wav|I don't know, said the hat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0577.wav|Look! The broom!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0578.wav|Look! The broom! cried the rat the bat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0579.wav|The broom flew into the room.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0580.wav|It zoomed over the mat,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0581.wav|over the cat,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0582.wav|over the hat and|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0584.wav|It landed on the hat,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0585.wav|which landed on the bat,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0586.wav|who landed on the rat,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0587.wav|who landed on the cat, lying flat on the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0589.wav|No we won't! said the hat and the bat and the ha rat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0591.wav|Wilma came home. She looked at the room. She picked up the broom.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0592.wav|Then she asked, Why is th fish out of the dish?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0594.wav|My dear little brat, said Wilma,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0595.wav|what makes you think this is your mat?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0596.wav|The fat cat smiled.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0597.wav|The fat cat got up and stretched, off.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0599.wav|Ate the fish, licked the dish, and went back to lie down in the vat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0600.wav|Thank goodness! said the mat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0601.wav|The end.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0602.wav|Okay, ready.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0603.wav|If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0604.wav|When you give him a milk|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0605.wav|He'll probably ask for a a straw.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0606.wav|When he's finished, he'll ask for a napkin.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0607.wav|Then he'll want to look in a mirror|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0609.wav|When he looks into the mirror,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0612.wav|When he's finished giving himself a ss a trim,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0613.wav|he'll want a broom to sweep up.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0614.wav|He'll start sweeping.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0615.wav|He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0616.wav|He may even end up washing the floors as well!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0617.wav|When he he's done, he'll probably want to take a nap.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0618.wav|You'll have to fix up a little box for him|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0619.wav|with a blanket and a pillow.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0620.wav|He'll crawl|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0621.wav|He'll crawl in make|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0622.wav|In.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0623.wav|make himself comfortable and fluff the pillow a few times.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0624.wav|He.|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0966.wav|No, Joe, said Mrs. Goodkind. Pickles has no home, and he does not want to live with me.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0967.wav|Why? Asked Joe.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0968.wav|Mrs. Goodkind answered, My home is too little for Pickles.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0970.wav|Look at his big paws.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0971.wav|Pickles put out a paw for Joe to see.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0972.wav|My goodness, Pickles, said Joe.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0973.wav|What big paws you have!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0974.wav|Pickles looked at Joe.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0975.wav|and said the one word he could say:|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0976.wav|And Joe could see that Pickles want something very much.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0977.wav|Joe gave Pickles a pat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0978.wav|Pickles, he said. I will take you to our firehouse. Maybe your sh our Chief will let us let you stay.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0979.wav|The Fire Cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0980.wav|The Fire Cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0981.wav|Joe took Pickles to the Chief, who was sitting at his desk.|0

wavs/robyn_robyn_0983.wav|He is the one a who chases little cats.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0984.wav|How do you know? asked Joe.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0985.wav|The Chief answered, A Fire Chief knows many things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0986.wav|Just then the telephone began to ring.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0989.wav|Well, we shall see. Thank you, Mrs. Goodkind. Good-bye.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0990.wav|The Chief looked at Pickles and said, Mrs. Goodkind says you are not a bad cat. And Joe likes you.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0991.wav|I will let you live here if you will learn to be a good firehouse cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0992.wav|Pickles wa Pickles walked quietly up the stairs after Joe.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0993.wav|Joe and Pickles went into a room where the firemen lived.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0995.wav|They wanted to play with Pickles.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0996.wav|But suddenly the fire bell rang. All the firemen ran to the big a big pole and down they wa went.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0997.wav|The pole was the fast way to get to their trucks.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0998.wav|Pickles could hear the trucks start up and rush off the fire.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_0999.wav|Pickles said to himself, I must learn to do what the firemen do.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1000.wav|I must learn to slide down the pole.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1001.wav|He jumped and put his paws around the pole.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1002.wav|Down the down he fell with a bump.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1003.wav|Bumps or no bumps, I must try again said Pickles.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1004.wav|Up the stairs he ran.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1005.wav|Down the pole he came and bumped, he tried again.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1006.wav|And bumped.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1008.wav|What a wonderful cat you are! said the firemen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1009.wav|The Chief did not say anything.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1010.wav|Pickles said to himself, I must keep on learning everything I can.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1011.wav|So he learned to jump up one on one of the big trucks.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1012.wav|And he learned to sit up straight to on the seat while the truck raced to a fire.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1013.wav|What a wonderful cat you are said the firemen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1014.wav|The Chief did not say anything.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1016.wav|At the next fire, he jumped down from the truck.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1017.wav|He ran to a big ha.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1018.wav|Whose.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1019.wav|put his paws around it, and tried to help a fireman|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1020.wav|shoot the water at the flames.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1021.wav|He ran to a big whose, put his paws around it, and tried to help a fireman|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1022.wav|shoot the water at the flames.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1023.wav|What a wonderful cat you are! said the firemen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1024.wav|The Chief did not say anything.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1025.wav|The Chief called all the firemen to his desk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1026.wav|Then he called for Pickles.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1027.wav|Pickles did not know what was going to happen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1028.wav|He said to himself, Maybe the Chief does not like the way I work.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1029.wav|Maybe he wants to send me back to my old yard.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1030.wav|But Pickles went to the Chief.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1031.wav|At the Chief's desk stood all the firemen - and Mrs. Goodkind!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1033.wav|Pickles jumped up on my desk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1034.wav|I have something to say to you, Pickles jump|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1035.wav|To you pickles jump on the desk and looked at the Chief. Out of the desk the Chief took|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1036.wav|A hat a little fire hat!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1037.wav|Pickles, said the Chief, he have watched you are at your work.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1038.wav|I have watched you at your work.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1039.wav|You have worked hard.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1040.wav|The time has come come for you to know that you are now our Fire Cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1041.wav|And with these words, the Chief put the little a hat on Pickles' head.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1042.wav|The Old Tree.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1043.wav|Pickles made friends, with all the firemen. But the he did not make friends with any cats. When|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1044.wav|When cats came to the firehouse to look at the trucks, people, Pickles chased them away.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1045.wav|The Chief called Pickles Pickles to him and said A Fire Cat must be kind to everyone.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1046.wav|You must be good to other cats.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1047.wav|Little by little, Pickles learned to be good to the cats he met me he met.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1048.wav|He, to be good to the cats he met.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1049.wav|He made friends with then them too.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1050.wav|Then all the cats loved to come to the firehouse.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1051.wav|On rainy days, on rainy days, most cats stayed at home, and Pickles sat upstairs with the firemen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1052.wav|One rainy day, as he sat there, he thought to himself How bad I was.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1053.wav|One cold morning, Dragon went out to find the perfect Christmas tree.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1054.wav|He walked through the crunchy snow.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1055.wav|He saw all sorts of trees.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1056.wav|Crude ones, and straight ones.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1057.wav|Finally, he found the most beautiful Christmas tree of all.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1058.wav|It was not too big, or too small.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1059.wav|It was not too crude, or too straight.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1060.wav|It was just right.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1061.wav|Dragon looked down and ss saw the tree's beautiful|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1062.wav|brown trunk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1063.wav|It stood firm and strong in the frozen earth.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1064.wav|He looked up and saw its beautiful green branches.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1065.wav|They waved back and forth in the cold December, wind.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1066.wav|Dragon could not cut down ss such a lovely tree.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1067.wav|Instead he came back with colored lights, silver bell and everything he needed to make his tree even more beautiful.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1068.wav|That night dra, that night Dragon looked out at his Christmas tree shining in the night. It was truly perfect.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1069.wav|The candy reth.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1070.wav|One day in December Dragon had a good idea.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1071.wav|I will make a reth out of candy, he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1072.wav|Dragon took some old wire and bent it into shape.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1073.wav|Then he taped little pieces of chocolate candy and all around it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1074.wav|When Dragon hung his candy reth one on the wall, the, one of the pieces of chocolate fell off.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1075.wav|Dragon picked it up and ate it.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1076.wav|It was very good.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1077.wav|Dragon did not want his reth to look bare, so he promised not to eat any more candy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1078.wav|I will eat only the pieces that fall off,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1079.wav|ss he said.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1080.wav|Dragon bumped his elbow against the wall|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1081.wav|and two more pieces of candy tell.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1082.wav|Dragon sat down in his chair and looked|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1083.wav|up at his candy reth.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1084.wav|He tried not to think about the smooth, rich, sweet creamy, dark chocolate candy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1085.wav|Dragon could not sit still.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1086.wav|He began to drool.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1087.wav|Suddenly, Dragon could not stop himself.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1090.wav|Dragon got a tummy ache from eating so much chocolate.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1091.wav|Next year, said Dragon, I will make my reth out of pin pine cones.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1092.wav|Dragon was always losing his mittens.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1093.wav|No matter how hard he tried, he could never keep track of them.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1094.wav|Whenever he needed them most, they were nowhere to be found.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1095.wav|So Dragon went and bought out and bought a pair of clip on mittens.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1096.wav|He clipped them to his coat sleeves, he he c would never lose his mittens again.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1097.wav|Merry Christmas dar Dragon.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1098.wav|Dragon loved Christmas.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1099.wav|Every year he saved his money, and every Christmas he bought wonderful presents for himself.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1100.wav|Dragon made a list of things he would buy.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1101.wav|Lots of food, a new coat, a big birdhouse.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1103.wav|Then Dragon finished his Christmas shopping|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1104.wav|the store clerk loaded everything into a big sack.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1105.wav|On his way home, Dragon passed some raccoons singing in the street.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1106.wav|The raccoons had no food to eat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1107.wav|they looked very hungry.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1108.wav|Dragon reached into his sack.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1109.wav|Out his big basket of food.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1110.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1111.wav|Then he passed an old reehun shoveling her sidewalk.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1112.wav|The reehun did not have a coat to wear.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1113.wav|She looked very cold.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1114.wav|Dragon reached into his sack and took out his new wool overcoat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1115.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1116.wav|Finally, Dragon saw two little birds si sitting on a branch.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1117.wav|The birds did not have a home to live in.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1118.wav|They looked very sad.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1119.wav|Dragon opened his big sack took out his birdhouse, and hung it on branch.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1120.wav|Merry Christmas, said Dragon.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1121.wav|When Dragon got home, his big sack was empty.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1122.wav|There were no presents left for him.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1123.wav|But Dragon did not feel sad.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1124.wav|He went upstairs to his quiet room and crawled beneath his soft warm quilt.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1125.wav|And later as he slept, Dragon dreamed he heard angels singing in the stairy night.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1126.wav|But I was wrong. I think we need three microscopes for this family.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1127.wav|How bad I was when I chased the other cats.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1128.wav|Once I chased a little cat up a tree. Oh, me! Oh, my!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1129.wav|Up a tree oh, me! Oh, my!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1130.wav|We didn't a, why did I do that?|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1131.wav|Suddenly Pickles heard the Chief call out, Cat in a tree!|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1133.wav|Pickles slid down after them.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1134.wav|He heard the Chief say The tree is in the old yard next to Mrs. Goodkind's house.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1135.wav|Oh, thought Pickles. That's the yard where I lived. And that's the tree.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1136.wav|The that's the tree Pickles jumped, Pickles jumped up an, on the truck with the three firemen.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1137.wav|Away they rode to the yard. And he, and there there, in the wind and the rain, stood Mrs. Goodkind, pointing to a very little cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1138.wav|The firemen put the firemen put a ladder against the tree. The ladder scared the little cat, and she ran to ha a high branch,|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1139.wav|where a fireman could not go. Joe said to Mrs. Goodkind, I don't know what to do. But Pickles knew knew.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1140.wav|He began to climb the ladder.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1141.wav|Pickles climbed up and up and up.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1142.wav|It was hard work. But at last he came to the top of the ladder.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1143.wav|Then he climbed up the tree until he came to the tree to the little cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1145.wav|He picked her up and took her gently down to Mrs. Good.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1146.wav|Mrs. Goodkind thanked Pickles.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1147.wav|Then he sh then she said to him, I always knew that some day you would do a big things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1148.wav|I always knew that someday you would do big things.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1149.wav|Today you have done something very big.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1150.wav|Pickles waved a paw at her.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1151.wav|As if to stay, Mrs. Goodkind.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1152.wav|Mrs. Goodkind, as, as if to stay, Mrs. Goodkind, this is only a beginning.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1153.wav|And he rode home to the firehouse a proud and happy cat.|0
wavs/robyn_robyn_1154.wav|The end.|0
